Welcome to my program!

Here are some instructions for the Smart Budgeter:

- In order to run the program, you will need to run it on software where Python and its packages (particularly Tkinter) are installed.
- When you run the program, your data will automatically save: your name, goal, and budgeting history.
- To erase your data, simply delete the JSON files on the side: the userData JSON file to renew your name and goal, and the budgetData JSON file to erase your budgeting history.

EXTRA INFO:

Since this is a new coding tool for me, I utilized various videos and websites to aid me in the process of coding this program.
